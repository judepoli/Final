The ideas which I would like to discuss here represent neither a theory
nor a methodology.
I would like to say, first of all, what has been the goal of my work
during the last twenty years. It has not been to analyze the phenomena
of power, nor to elaborate the foundations of such an analysis.	<div id = "ball" ></div>
<b>My objective, instead, has been to create a history of the different
modes by which, in our culture, human beings are made subjects. </b> My
work has dealt with three modes of objectification which transform
human beings into subjects.
The first is the modes of inquiry which try to give themselves the
status of sciences; for example, the objectivizing of the speaking subject
in grammaire generale, philology, and linguistics. Or again, in this first
mode, the objectivizing of the productive subject, the subject who labors,
in the analysis of wealth and of economics. Or, a third example, the
objectivizing of the sheer fact of being alive in natural history or biology.
In the second part of my work, I have studied the objectivizing of
the subject in what I shall call "dividing practices." The subject is eitherdivided inside himself or divided from others. This process objectivizes
him. Examples are the mad and the sane, the sick and the healthy, the
criminals and the "good boys."
Finally, I have sought to study-it is my current work-the way a
human being turns himself into a subject. For example, I have chosen
the domain of sexuality-how men have learned to recognize themselves
as subjects of "sexuality."
Thus, it is not power but the subject which is the general theme of
my research.
It is true that I became quite involved with the question of power. It
soon appeared to me that, while the human subject is placed in relations
of production and of signification, he is equally placed in power relations
which are very complex. Now, it seemed to me that economic history and
theory provided a good instrument for relations of production and that
linguistics and semiotics offered instruments for studying relations of
signification; but for power relations we had no tools of study. We had
recourse only to ways of thinking about power based on legal models,
that is: What legitimates power? Or, we had recourse to ways of thinking
about power based on institutional models, that is: What is the state?
It was therefore necessary to expand the dimensions of a definition
of power if one wanted to use this definition in studying the objectivizing
of the subject.
Do we need a theory of power? Since a theory assumes a prior
objectification, it cannot be asserted as a basis for analytical work. But
this analytical work cannot proceed without an ongoing conceptualization. And this conceptualization implies critical thought-a constant
checking.
The first thing to check is what I shall call the "conceptual needs." I
mean that the conceptualization should not be founded on a theory of
the object-the conceptualized object is not the single criterion of a good
conceptualization. We have to know the historical conditions which
motivate our conceptualization. We need a historical awareness of our
present circumstance.
The second thing to check is the type of reality with which we are
dealing.
A writer in a well-known French newspaper once expressed his
surprise: "Why is the notion of power raised by so many people today? Isit such an important subject? Is it so independent that it can be discussed
without taking into account other problems?"
This writer's surprise amazes me. I feel skeptical about the assumption that this question has been raised for the first time in the twentieth
century. Anyway, for us it is not only a theoretical question but a part of
our experience. I'd like to mention only two "pathological forms"-those
two "diseases of power"-fascism and Stalinism. One of the numerous
reasons why they are, for us, so puzzling is that in spite of their historical
uniqueness they are not quite original. They used and extended mechanisms already present in most other societies. More than that: in spite of
their own internal madness, they used to a large extent the ideas and the
devices of our political rationality.
What we need is a new economy of power relations-the word "economy" being used in its theoretical and practical sense. To put it in other
words: since Kant, the role of philosophy is to prevent reason from
going beyond the limits of what is given in experience; but from the
same moment-that is, since the development of the modern state and
the political management of society-the role of philosophy is also to
keep watch over the excessive powers of political rationality, which is a
rather high expectation.
Everybody is aware of such banal facts. But the fact that they're
banal does not mean they don't exist. What we have to do with banal
facts is to discover-or try to discover-which specific and perhaps
original problem is connected with them.
The relationship between rationalization and excesses of political
power is evident. And we should not need to wait for bureaucracy or
concentration camps to recognize the existence of such relations. But the
problem is: What to do with such an evident fact?
Shall we try reason? To my mind, nothing would be more sterile.
First, because the field has nothing to do with guilt or innocence. Second,
because it is senseless to refer to reason as the contrary entity to nonreason. Last, because such a trial would trap us into playing the arbitrary and boring part of either the rationalist or the irrationalist.
Shall we investigate this kind of rationalism which seems to be
specific to our modern culture and which originates in Aufkldrung? I
think that was the approach of some of the members of the Frankfurt
School. My purpose, however, is not to start a discussion of their works,
although they are most important and valuable. Rather, I would suggest
another way of investigating the links between rationalization and
power. <div id="block1"></div>
It may be wise not to take as a whole the rationalization of society or
of culture but to analyze such a process in several fields, each with reference to a fundamental experience: madness, illness, death, crime, sexuality, and so forth.
I think that the word "rationalization" is dangerous. What we have to do is analyze specific rationalities rather than always invoke the progress of rationalization in general.
Even if the Aufkliirung has been a very important phase in our history and in the development of political technology, I think we have to
refer to much more remote processes if we want to understand how we
have been trapped in our own history.

I would like to suggest another way to go further toward a new
economy of power relations, a way which is more empirical, more directly related to our present situation, and which implies more relations
between theory and practice. It consists of taking the forms of resistance
against different forms of power as a starting point. To use another
metaphor, it consists of using this resistance as a chemical catalyst so as to
bring to light power relations, locate their position, and find out their
point of application and the methods used. Rather than analyzing power
from the point of view of its internal rationality, it consists of analyzing
power relations through the antagonism of strategies.
For example, to find out what our society means by sanity, perhaps
we should investigate what is happening in the field of insanity.
And what we mean by legality in the field of illegality.
And, in order to understand what power relations are about,
perhaps we should investigate the forms of resistance and attempts
made to dissociate these relations.</div>
